## Description

### Overview

The application Energy Manager provides information about how much energy has been consumed at any time. It will help to make the transition from energy transparency to energy efficiency. By analyzing the energy consumption together with the process data, processes and plants can be optimized. The Energy Manager provides one or more dashboards for data and energy analysis. Depending on the needs, there are several widget types available.

This repository describes how to use the Energy Manager for analyzing and optimizing energy consumption.

### General task

![overview](docs/graphics/Overview.PNG)

A PLC controls a filling process and the relevant energy data is collected by an Edge Device via the OPC UA Connector. On the Edge Device the data is published to the internal Databus. Then the data must be collected and modeled via the Data Service. From there the Energy Manager can retrieve the data for further analysis. First, we will proceed some KPI calculations. Then a custom dashboard with some widgets is created to visualize the energy data. Finally, we automatically create a dashboard using the energy media analysis.

## Requirements

### Prerequisities

### TIA Project

The used TIA Portal project can be found in the [miscellenous repository](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/tree/main/tank%20application) and is also used for several further application examples.

## Configuration steps

To setup the PLC connection that is required to use the Energy Manager, several applications must be configured.

You can find further information about the configuration steps [here](/docs/Installation.md).

## Usage

The Energy Manager can be used for analyzing energy data.

You can find detailed information about the usage [here](/docs/Usage.md):

- KPI calculation within the Energy Manager
- Data analysis using widgets
- Energy media analysis
